# 16 Day Python Learning Challenge
## Learning Python via small projects

The projects are taken from the *Total Python: You Can Master Python Programming in 16 Days* course on Udemy.

## Day One 

>*You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that
require a single word each and then displays those combined words on the screen to
form a creative brand.*


## Day Two 

>*The situation is this: You work in a company where salespeople receive 13%
commissions on their total sales, and your boss wants you to help the salespeople
calculate their commissions by creating a program that asks them their name and
how much they've sold this month.
Your program will answer them with a sentence that includes their name and the
amount of commissions they are entitled to*



## Day Three 


>*The task is as follows:
You are going to create a program that first asks the user to
enter text. It can be any text, an entire article, a paragraph, a sentence, a poem,
whatever you want. Then the program will ask the user to enter three random letters.
From that moment on, our code is going to process that information and result in five
different types of analysis:*
*>1. How many times each of those letters they have chosen appears.*
*>2. How many words are in the whole text?*
*>3. What are the first and last letters of the text?*
*>4. The system will show us how the text would look like if we inverted the order of the words.*
*>5. The system will tell us if the word “Python”*


## Day Four 


>*The task is this: 
The program will ask for the user's name and then it will say something like: “Well John, I've thought of a number between 1 and 100 and you have only eight tries to guess it. What number do you think it is?” On each try, the player will say a number and the program can answer for different things.*
*>1. If the number the user said is less than 1 or greater than 100, it will tell them that he/she has chosen a number that is out of play.*
*>2. If the number the user chose is less than the number the program thought of, it will tell them that the answer is wrong, and that he/she chose a lower number than the secret number.*
*>3. If the user chose a number greater than the secret number, it will let them know that it was greater.*
*>4. And if the user got the secret number right, they will be informed that they have won, and how many tries that has taken them*
*>5. If the user has not guessed correctly in their first attempt, they will be asked again to choose another number and so on until they win or until their eight attempts are done*

## Day Five


>*Today you are going to program the hangman game.
>It's simple, popular, but if you don't know it, let me explain it really quickly: The program will choose a secret word and we'll show the player only a series of dashes that represent the number of letters in the word. In each turn, the player must choose a letter: if that letter is in the hidden word, the system will show where it is located, but if the player chooses a letter that is not in the hidden word, they lose a life.
In the real hangman game, each time we lose a life, the drawing of the hangman is completed limb by limb. But in our case, as we still do not have the graphic elements, we will simply tell the user that they have six lives, and we will deduct them one by one for each time the player chooses an incorrect letter.*

## Day Six

>*Today you are going to create a recipe manager. 
It’s a program by which a user can read, create and delete recipes from a database. Before you start, you need to create a folder directory in the base folder of your computer: it is a folder called Recipes, which contains four subfolders and each of them contains two text files. 
Inside the files, you can write whatever you want. It's not important what it says in each in each text file for this exercise. If you prefer, you can download and unzip the file that we've attached to this lecture and place it in the root directory, if you don't feel like building out that structure yourself. 
Once you have done that, here comes your task:
Your code will first welcome the user, tell them the path to the directory where our Recipes folder is located, tell them how many recipes there are inside the folder, and then ask them to choose one of these options:*

*>1. Option 1 will ask the user “Which category do you choose?” Meats, salads, desserts… whatever categories you want. And once the user chooses a category, it will ask them “Which recipe do you want to read?” And then it will show the content of that recipe.*

*>2. Option 2 is getting the user to create a new recipe in a specific category: it will also ask the user to choose a category, but then it will ask the user to write the name and content of a new recipe, and it will create that file in the correct place.*
   
*>3. Option 3 will ask for the name of the category the user wants to create and will generate a brand new folder, a new category with that name*
   
*>4. Option 4 will delete recipes: it’ll do the same as option one, but instead of reading the recipe, it will delete it.*
   
*>5. Option 5 will let the user delete a category, asking “Which category do you want to delete?”*
   
*>6. Option 6 will end the execution of the code (just end the program).*
